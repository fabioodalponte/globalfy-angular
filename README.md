Finished the assessment, pretty simple screen
I added a simple user to list in Angular Material
It is possible filter by username

We can add one user, edit one user
To remove one user we need login with the password, after that it adds on localStorage a jwt_token
when we logout, it remove the JWT token and it is not possible delete.
If the user is not logged, it get a 401 error and show an error using Toastr
